# Ashish Chhabra

**AI/ML Engineer** | Building retrieval systems, agentic AI tools, and data-driven platforms.

Final-year AI & Data Science student at NMIT Bangalore. I build AI systems that work beyond the notebook -- RAG pipelines that don't hallucinate, tools that AI agents can reason with, and models that drive real decisions. I care about clean architecture, evaluation rigor, and ML that ships to production.

## What I Build

### AI/ML Systems

| Project | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| [**Conversation API**](https://github.com/AshC2004/conversation-api) | Production-grade REST API for AI-powered conversations with FastAPI, Supabase, and multi-provider LLM support (Groq + Google AI). SSE streaming, token counting, cost tracking, ownership enforcement. 26 integration tests, full OpenAPI docs. |
| [**MCP Financial Server**](https://github.com/AshC2004/mcp-financial-server) | Model Context Protocol server exposing financial data tools over Supabase PostgreSQL. Query company profiles, financial reports, stock prices, and analyst ratings for Claude Desktop and Cursor. |
| [**Document Intelligence**](https://github.com/AshC2004/document-intelligence) | RAG pipeline using LangChain + Pinecone for technical Q&A. Cross-encoder re-ranking, source attribution, 65% hallucination reduction, sub-2s latency. |
| [**MCP Server**](https://github.com/AshC2004/MCP) | Model Context Protocol server for data contract impact analysis. AI agents autonomously analyze schema changes and trace downstream dependencies. |
| [**TOON**](https://github.com/AshC2004/TOON-Token-Object-Oriented-Notation-) | Token-efficient code notation for LLMs. AST-based compression that reduces token usage by 50-70%. Zero dependencies. |

### Data Science & Analytics

| Project | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **NSE Stock Portfolio Analytics** | Predictive models for portfolio risk assessment (VaR, CVaR, Sharpe ratio) across 50+ NSE stocks. Power BI dashboards with 15+ KPIs. |

### Software Engineering

| Project | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| [**Email Service**](https://github.com/AshC2004/Email_Service) | Transactional email API with async processing (RabbitMQ), rate limiting (Redis), retry logic, and dead letter queues. Fully containerized. |
| [**How to GitHub**](https://github.com/AshC2004/How_to_Github) | Open-source guide to Git workflows -- 10 chapters from beginner to CI/CD. |
